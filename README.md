# FileCmp - quick and easy file comparison for windows

* Drag and drop files into the ui and FileCmp calculates the md5sum of the file and displays it.
* Copy the md5sum to clipboard by clicking on the file row.
* Drop multiple files and see which ones are identical by hovering over the file rows

## To-Do / Known bugs

* Better code documentation
* Remove file from ui
* Some response when copying md5sum to clipboard
